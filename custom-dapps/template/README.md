# Template DApp

Template is a customized DApp written in Python, which originally resembles the one provided by the sample [Echo DApp](https://github.com/cartesi/rollups-examples/tree/main/echo).

The documentation below is simply a copy of the one provided there and should be used to both run the original template code and as a basis for the documentation of any DApp created based on this template.

## Building the environment

To run the template example, clone the repository as follows:

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/cartesi/rollups-examples.git
```

Then, build the back-end for the template example:

```shell
$ cd rollups-examples/template
$ make machine
```

## Running the environment

In order to start the containers in production mode, simply run:

```shell
$ docker-compose up --build
```

_Note:_ If you decide to use [Docker Compose V2](https://docs.docker.com/compose/cli-command/), make sure you set the [compatibility flag](https://docs.docker.com/compose/cli-command-compatibility/) when executing the command (e.g., `docker compose --compatibility up`).

Allow some time for the infrastructure to be ready.
How much will depend on your system, but after some time showing the error `"concurrent call in session"`, eventually the container logs will repeatedly show the following:

```shell
server_manager_1      | Received GetVersion
server_manager_1      | Received GetStatus
server_manager_1      |   default_rollups_id
server_manager_1      | Received GetSessionStatus for session default_rollups_id
server_manager_1      |   0
server_manager_1      | Received GetEpochStatus for session default_rollups_id epoch 0
```

To stop the containers, first end the process with `Ctrl + C`.
Then, remove the containers and associated volumes by executing:

```shell
$ docker-compose down -v
```

## Interacting with the application

With the infrastructure in place, you can interact with the application using a set of Hardhat tasks.

First, go to a separate terminal window, switch to the `template/contracts` directory, and run `yarn`:

```shell
$ cd template/contracts/
$ yarn
```

Then, send an input as follows:

```shell
$ npx hardhat --network localhost template:addInput --input "0x63617274657369"
```

The input will have been accepted when you receive a response similar to the following one:

```shell
Added input '0x63617274657369' to epoch '0' (index '0', timestamp: 1640643170, signer: 0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266, tx: 0x31d7e9e810d8702196623837b8512097786b544a4b5ffb52f693b9ff7d424147)
```

In order to verify the notices generated by your inputs, run the command:

```shell
$ npx hardhat --network localhost template:getNotices --epoch 0
```

The response should be something like this:

```shell
{"session_id":"default_rollups_id","epoch_index":"0","input_index":"0","notice_index":"0","payload":"63617274657369"}
```

You can also send inputs as regular strings. For example:

```shell
$ npx hardhat --network localhost template:addInput --input 'Hello there!'
```

To retrieve notices interpreting the payload as a UTF-8 string, you can use the `--payload string` option:

```shell
$ npx hardhat --network localhost template:getNotices --epoch 0 --payload string
{"session_id":"default_rollups_id","epoch_index":"0","input_index":"1","notice_index":"0","payload":"Hello there!"}
```

Finally, note that you can check the available options for all Hardhat tasks using the `--help` switch:

```shell
$ npx hardhat --help
```

## Advancing time

To advance time, in order to simulate the passing of epochs, run:

```shell
$ npx hardhat --network localhost util:advanceTime --seconds 864010
```

## Running the environment in host mode

When developing an application, it is often important to easily test and debug it. For that matter, it is possible to run the Cartesi Rollups environment in [host mode](../README.md#host-mode), so that the DApp's back-end can be executed directly on the host machine, allowing it to be debugged using regular development tools such as an IDE.

The first step is to run the environment in host mode using the following command:

```shell
$ docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose-host.yml up --build
```

The next step is to run the template server in your machine. The application is written in Python, so you need to have `python3` installed.

In order to start the template server, run the following commands in a dedicated terminal:

```shell
$ cd template/server/
$ python3 -m venv .env
$ . .env/bin/activate
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$ HTTP_DISPATCHER_URL="http://127.0.0.1:5004" gunicorn --reload --workers 1 --bind 0.0.0.0:5003 template:app
```

This will run the template server on port `5003` and send the corresponding notices to port `5004`. The server will also automatically reload if there is a change in the source code, enabling fast development iterations.

The final command, which effectively starts the server, can also be configured in an IDE to allow interactive debugging using features like breakpoints. In that case, it may be interesting to add the parameter `--timeout 0` to gunicorn, to avoid having it time out when the debugger stops at a breakpoint.

After the server successfully starts, it should print an output like the following:

```
[2022-01-21 12:38:23,971] INFO in template: HTTP dispatcher url is http://127.0.0.1:5004
[2022-01-21 12:38:23 -0500] [79032] [INFO] Starting gunicorn 19.9.0
[2022-01-21 12:38:23 -0500] [79032] [INFO] Listening at: http://0.0.0.0:5003 (79032)
[2022-01-21 12:38:23 -0500] [79032] [INFO] Using worker: sync
[2022-01-21 12:38:23 -0500] [79035] [INFO] Booting worker with pid: 79035
```

After that, you can interact with the application normally [as explained above](#interacting-with-the-application).

When you add an input, you should see it being processed by the template server as follows:

```shell
[2022-01-21 15:58:39,555] INFO in template: Received advance request body {'metadata': {'msg_sender': '0xf39fd6e51aad88f6f4ce6ab8827279cfffb92266', 'epoch_index': 0, 'input_index': 0, 'block_number': 11, 'time_stamp': 1642791522}, 'payload': '0x636172746573690d0a'}
[2022-01-21 15:58:39,556] INFO in template: Adding notice
[2022-01-21 15:58:39,650] INFO in template: Received notice status 201 body b'{"index":0}'
[2022-01-21 15:58:39,651] INFO in template: Finishing
[2022-01-21 15:58:39,666] INFO in template: Received finish status 202
```

Finally, to stop the containers, removing any associated volumes, execute:

```shell
$ docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose-host.yml down -v
```
