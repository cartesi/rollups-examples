# Cartesi Rollups Examples

This repository includes examples of decentralized applications implemented using [Cartesi Rollups](https://github.com/cartesi/rollups).

## Introduction
From a developerâ€™s point of view, each decentralized application or _DApp_ is composed of two main parts: a **front-end** and a **back-end**.

The **front-end** corresponds to the user-facing interface, which for these examples will often correspond to a command-line interface in the form of Hardhat tasks.

On the other hand, the **back-end** contains the business logic of the application, similar to what traditional systems would run inside a server. Its basic goal is to store and update the application state as user input is received, producing corresponding outputs. These outputs can come in the form of **vouchers** (transactions that can be carried out on Layer-1, such as a transfer of assets) and **notices** (informational statements, such as the resulting score of a game).

When compared to traditional software development, the main difference of a Cartesi DApp is that the back-end is deployed to a decentralized network of Layer-2 nodes, who continuously verify the correctness of all processing results. As a consequence, the front-end and back-end do not communicate directly with each other. Rather, the front-end sends inputs to the Cartesi Rollups framework, who in turn makes them available to the back-end instances running inside each node. After the inputs are processed by the back-end logic, the corresponding outputs are then informed back to the Rollups framework, which enforces their correctness and makes them available to the front-end and any other interested parties.

## HTTP API

As discussed above, the front-end and back-end parts of a Cartesi DApp communicate with each other through the Rollups framework. This is accomplished in practice by using an HTTP API.
### Back-end

The DApp's back-end needs to implement a couple of endpoints to receive requests from the Cartesi Rollups framework. These are specified by Cartesi's [HTTP DApp API](https://github.com/cartesi/openapi-interfaces/blob/master/dapp.yaml).

As the back-end processes the inputs received, it can access a second set of HTTP endpoints provided by the Rollups framework itself, in order to inform it of the computed results and consequences. These are defined by the [HTTP Dispatcher API](https://github.com/cartesi/openapi-interfaces/blob/master/dispatcher.yaml).

### Front-end

The front-end part of the DApp needs to access the Cartesi Rollups framework to submit user inputs and retrieve the corresponding vouchers and notices produced by the back-end.

In practice, the examples presented here will usually perform these actions using Hardhat tasks already provided by the Rollups framework.

## Building and running

In general, each application can be executed in 2 modes, as explained below.

### Production mode

In this mode, the DApp's back-end logic is cross-compiled to the RISC-V architecture and executed inside a Cartesi Machine. This ensures that the computation performed by the back-end is _reproducible_ and hence _verifiable_, enabling a truly trustless and decentralized execution.

### Host mode

The _Cartesi Rollups Host Environment_ provides the very same HTTP API as the regular one, mimicking the behavior of the actual Layer-1 and Layer-2 components. This way, the Cartesi Rollups infrastructure can make HTTP requests to a back-end that is running natively on localhost. This allows the developer to test and debug the back-end logic using familiar tools, such as an IDE.

_Note_: when running in host mode, localhost ports `5003` and `5004` will be used by default for the communication between the Cartesi Rollups framework and the DApp's back-end.

## Examples

### 1. [Simple Echo DApp](./echo)

A basic "hello world" application, this DApp's back-end simply copies each input received as a corresponding output notice.

### 2. [KNN DApp](./ml)

An DApp which implements and uses supervised Learning KNN in the classic IRIS database.
