# Simple Echo DApp

This example shows how to build and interact with a minimalistic Cartesi Rollups application that simply copies (or "echoes") each input received as a corresponding output notice. This DApp's back-end is written in Python.

## Building the environment

To run the echo example, clone the repository as follows:

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/cartesi/rollups-examples.git
```

Then, build the back-end for the echo example:

```shell
$ cd rollups-examples/echo
$ make machine
```

## Running the environment

In order to start the containers in production mode, simply run:

```shell
$ docker-compose up --build
```

_Note:_ If you decide to use [Docker Compose V2](https://docs.docker.com/compose/cli-command/), make sure you set the [compatibility flag](https://docs.docker.com/compose/cli-command-compatibility/) when executing the command (e.g., `docker compose --compatibility up`).

Allow some time for the infrastructure to be ready.
How much will depend on your system, but after some time showing the error `"concurrent call in session"`, eventually the container logs will repeatedly show the following:

```shell
server_manager_1      | Received GetVersion
server_manager_1      | Received GetStatus
server_manager_1      |   default_rollups_id
server_manager_1      | Received GetSessionStatus for session default_rollups_id
server_manager_1      |   0
server_manager_1      | Received GetEpochStatus for session default_rollups_id epoch 0
```

To stop the containers, first end the process with `Ctrl + C`.
Then, remove the containers and associated volumes by executing:

```shell
$ docker-compose down -v
```

## Interacting with the application

With the infrastructure in place, go to a separate terminal window and send an input as follows:

```shell
$ docker exec echo_hardhat_1 npx hardhat --network localhost echo:addInput --input "0x636172746573690D0A"
```

The input will have been accepted when you receive a response similar to the following one:

```shell
Added input '0x636172746573690D0A' to epoch '0' (timestamp: 1640643170, signer: 0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266, tx: 0x31d7e9e810d8702196623837b8512097786b544a4b5ffb52f693b9ff7d424147)
```

In order to verify the notices generated by your inputs, run the command:

```shell
$ curl http://localhost:4000/graphql -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{ "query" : "query getNotice { GetNotice( query: { session_id: \"default_rollups_id\", epoch_index: \"0\", input_index: \"0\" } ) { session_id epoch_index input_index notice_index payload } }" }'
```

The response should be something like this:

```shell
{"data":{"GetNotice":[{"session_id":"default_rollups_id","epoch_index":"0","input_index":"0","notice_index":"0","payload":"63617274657369da"}]}}
```

## Advancing time

To advance time, in order to simulate the passing of epochs, run:

```shell
$ docker exec echo_hardhat_1 npx hardhat --network localhost util:advanceTime --seconds 864010
```

## Running the environment in host mode

When developing an application, it is often important to easily test and debug it. For that matter, it is possible to run the Cartesi Rollups environment in [host mode](../README.md#host-mode), so that the DApp's back-end can be executed directly on the host machine, allowing it to be debugged using regular development tools such as an IDE.

The first step is to run the environment in host mode using the following command:

```shell
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose-host.yml up --build
```

The next step is to run the echo server in your machine. The application is written in Python, so you need to have `python3` installed.

In order to start the echo server, run the following commands in a dedicated terminal:

```shell
cd echo/server/
python3 -m venv .env
. .env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
HTTP_DISPATCHER_URL="http://127.0.0.1:5004" gunicorn --reload --workers 1 --bind 0.0.0.0:5003 echo:app
```

This will run the echo server on port `5003` and send the corresponding notices to port `5004`. The server will also automatically reload if there is a change in the source code, enabling fast development iterations.

The final command, which effectively starts the server, can also be configured in an IDE to allow interactive debugging using features like breakpoints. In that case, it may be interesting to add the parameter `--timeout 0` to gunicorn, to avoid having it time out when the debugger stops at a breakpoint.

After the server successfully starts, it should print an output like the following:

```
[2022-01-21 12:38:23,971] INFO in echo: HTTP dispatcher url is http://127.0.0.1:5004
[2022-01-21 12:38:23 -0500] [79032] [INFO] Starting gunicorn 19.9.0
[2022-01-21 12:38:23 -0500] [79032] [INFO] Listening at: http://0.0.0.0:5003 (79032)
[2022-01-21 12:38:23 -0500] [79032] [INFO] Using worker: sync
[2022-01-21 12:38:23 -0500] [79035] [INFO] Booting worker with pid: 79035
```

After that, you can interact with the application normally [as explained above](#interacting-with-the-application).

When you add an input, you should see it being processed by the echo server as follows:

```shell
[2022-01-21 15:58:39,555] INFO in echo: Received advance request body {'metadata': {'msg_sender': '0xf39fd6e51aad88f6f4ce6ab8827279cfffb92266', 'epoch_index': 0, 'input_index': 0, 'block_number': 11, 'time_stamp': 1642791522}, 'payload': '0x636172746573690d0a'}
[2022-01-21 15:58:39,556] INFO in echo: Adding notice
[2022-01-21 15:58:39,650] INFO in echo: Received notice status 201 body b'{"index":0}'
[2022-01-21 15:58:39,651] INFO in echo: Finishing
[2022-01-21 15:58:39,666] INFO in echo: Received finish status 202
```

Finally, to stop the containers, removing any associated volumes, execute:

```shell
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose-host.yml down -v
```
