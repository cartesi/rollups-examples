# DEFINES TRAINING DATA AND ALGORITHM FOR BUILDING THE MODEL
#

# - model algorithm

# - dataset feature to be predicted (dependent variable)
dependent_var = "Survived"



#
# READS AND PREPARES DATA
#

# - reads data into a pandas dataframe
train_df = pd.read_csv(train_csv)
if include:
     train_df = train_df[include]

# - pre-processes data to apply One Hot Encoding (OHE) and fill in absent values

          # for numerical types, fills in absent values with zeros

#
# EXPORTS MODEL
#

# - uses m2cgen to convert model to pure python code with zero dependencies
#   obs: generated Python code will define a method called `score(input)`, which computes
#        a numerical score based on an input list where each entry corresponds to one of
#        the model's input features/columns. If the dependent variable is a class with
#        more than 2 categories, then the output of the method will be a list of scores
#        for each category.
model_to_python = m2c.export_to_python(model)

# - gathers final model's input features/columns and possible output classes
model_columns = list(x.columns)
model_classes = train_df[dependent_var].unique().tolist()

# - writes model to file `model.py` in the parent directory (m2cgen/backend)
