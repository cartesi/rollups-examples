# Frontend Console

This project demonstrates how to implement a console application to send inputs to a Cartesi Rollups DApp, both running locally and deployed on remote testnet networks.
It's implemented in Typescript and uses the [ethers](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/) library to communicate with the rollups smart contracts.

## Requirements

- node.js
- yarn

## Building

To build the console application, first clone the repository as follows:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/cartesi/rollups-examples.git
```

Then, build the application by executing the following commands:

```shell
cd frontend-console/
yarn
yarn build
```

## Running

The console application can be used to perform several operations. The available commands can be queried as follows:

```shell
$ yarn start --help

Commands:
  index.ts erc20 <command>  Operations with ERC20 tokens
  index.ts notices          List notices of an epoch and input
  index.ts send             Send string input to DApp

Options:
  --help     Show help                                                 [boolean]
  --version  Show version number                                       [boolean]
```

In general terms, the application communicates with a Cartesi DApp through two different endpoints, one for layer-1 communication (underlying blockchain) and another for layer-2 communication (Cartesi Node). Layer-1 communication is used for sending data to the DApp, including depositing assets. On the other hand, communication through the layer-2 node is used when querying DApp information such as provable outputs (notices, vouchers) and application logs (reports), or when performing generic application-level queries (inspect).

### Sending inputs

The `send` command adds inputs to a Cartesi Rollups DApp and has the following format:

```shell
yarn start send --input [message] <options>
```

Examples:

1. Send an input to the current locally deployed DApp using Hardhat's default funded account:

   ```shell
   yarn start send --input "my message"
   ```

1. Send an input to an instance of the `echo-python` DApp already deployed on Polygon Mumbai testnet, using a user's account and a user's gateway RPC on Alchemy:

   ```shell
   export MNEMONIC=<user sequence of twelve words>
   export RPC_URL=https://polygon-mumbai.g.alchemy.com/v2/<USER_KEY>

   yarn start send --input "my message" --dapp echo-python
   ```

#### Options

When sending data to a DApp, the console application needs to communicate with the underlying layer-1 blockchain. In order to do that, it needs the URL of a blockchain RPC gateway, the address of the DApp's Rollups smart contract on that blockchain, and an appropriate account with sufficient funds for submitting transactions to the network.

The following parameters are available to specify this configuration, with some default behaviors and values to make it convenient to the user, especially for a local development environment:

- **`--rpc`**: provides the RPC URL of the remote blockchain gateway; if absent, its default value is "http://localhost:8545", which provides connectivity to the Hardhat node used for local development; it may also be specified by setting a value for the environment variable `RPC_URL`;
- **`--address`**: represents an explicit definition for the address of the DApp's Rollups smart contract, given as a hex string; if absent, the console application will look for other ways to determine this address, as explained below
- **`--addressFile`**: provides a path to a file containing the address as a hex string, and is only used if `address` is absent
- **`--dapp`**: specifies the name of the DApp, with a default value of "dapp"; if both `address` and `addressFile` are absent, the console application will query the given RPC instance to infer the network being used, and will extract the DApp's address from file `../deployments/<network>/<dapp>.address`; as such, if none of the above parameters are specified, the DApp address will be determined by looking for the file `../deployments/localhost/dapp.address`;
- **`--mnemonic`**: determines an account for submitting transactions; when using the `localhost` network, the application will use the default `mnemonic` for the local Hardhat node, which is already funded; otherwise, you must define a mnemonic for an account that has funds in the specified network; you can also define this parameter by setting the `MNEMONIC` environment variable;
- **`--accountIndex`**: specifies an account index to use from the provided mnemonic; if absent, index `0` is used;

### Listing notices

The `notices` command lists DApp notices associated with the given epoch and input.

```shell
yarn start notices <options>
```

Examples:

1. List all notices ever emitted for the current locally deployed DApp:

   ```shell
   yarn start notices
   ```

1. List notices for epoch `1` and input `3` of the `echo-python` DApp instance already deployed on Polygon Mumbai testnet:

   ```shell
   yarn start notices --url https://echo-python.polygon-mumbai.rollups.staging.cartesi.io/graphql --epoch 1 --input 3
   ```

Options are:

```shell
--url      Reader URL
--epoch    Epoch index
--input    Input index
```

If the `url` parameter is absent, the console application will use a default value of "http://localhost:4000/graphql", which provides connectivity to a local Cartesi Node.

### Depositing ERC-20 tokens

The `erc20 deposit` command deposits ERC-20 tokens in the DApp.

```shell
yarn start erc20 deposit --amount [amount] <options>
```

Examples:

1. Deposit 10 CTSI in the locally deployed DApp:

   ```shell
   yarn start erc20 deposit --amount 10000000000000000000
   ```

1. Deposit 10 CTSI in the `echo-python` DApp instance already deployed on Polygon Mumbai testnet, using a user's account and a user's gateway RPC on Alchemy:

   ```shell
   export MNEMONIC=<user sequence of twelve words>
   export RPC_URL=https://polygon-mumbai.g.alchemy.com/v2/<USER_KEY>
   
   yarn start erc20 deposit --amount 10000000000000000000 --dapp echo-python
   ```

Options are:

```shell
--erc20         ERC-20 address
--rpc           URL of the RPC gateway to use
--address       DApp Rollups contract address
--addressFile   Path to a file containing the DApp Rollups contract address
--dapp          DApp name
--mnemonic      Wallet mnemonic
--accountIndex  Account index from mnemonic
```

If the `erc20` address is unspecified, the appropriate address for the CTSI token will be used for the target blockchain being specified.

Aside from that, the other parameters have the same behavior as described for the [send](#options) command.
